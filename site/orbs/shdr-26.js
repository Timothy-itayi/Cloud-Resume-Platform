    Stereographic projection of the UNROTATED dome.

    This orb was built on the abs(sp.z) form first — the one shdr-28
    and shdr-29 use, which survives a 3D roll because the divisor can
    only fall TO zero at the terminator, never through it. It renders, but
    every quarter turn it makes the visible hemisphere an EXACT mirror
    image about the view axis: at a roll of 90 degrees sp becomes
    (-n.z, n.y, n.x), so the projected coordinate depends on n.z and on
    abs(n.x), and both of those are even in screen x. A cellular grid
    hides that. A web of long threads does not — the ball turns into a
    Rorschach blot for a quarter of every revolution.

    So the dome stays put, as in shdr-08, and all the motion below is
    projection-safe 2D.

    The other half of that fix is in the presets: the chromatic split makes
    the three channels independent, so at a wide split THREAD sets the hue

    Taken from lev — the MEAN of the three channels — deliberately, so the
